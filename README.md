GitRows makes it easy to use and store data in GitHub and GitLab repos. You can read data stored in `.csv` and `.json` files from **all public repos** and read, create, update and delete data in **public or private repos** that you have access to.

GitRows works with `node` and in all modern `browsers`. Alternatively learn more on [gitrows.com](https://gitrows.com) how to use GitRows' free API to integrate data into your websites/apps.
